    <p>Here are a few of the most frequently asked questions
    specifically regarding Abyssinica SIL:</p>
    <h4 id="what-is-so-special-about-abyssinica-sil"><em>What is so
    special about Abyssinica SIL?</em></h4>
    <p>This font is designed to work with two advanced font
    technologies, Graphite and OpenType. To take advantage of the
    advanced typographic capabilities of this font, you must be using
    applications that provide an adequate level of support for Graphite
    or OpenType. These advanced capabilities provide access to the
    variant character forms used in some languages.</p>
    <h4 id="do-you-supply-a-keyboard-to-use-with-abyssinica-sil"><em>Do
    you supply a keyboard to use with Abyssinica SIL?</em></h4>
    <p>No keyboards are supplied with the font. However, there are
    suggested keyboards listed in <a
    href="resources.html">Resources</a>.</p>
    <h4
    id="my-language-uses-variant-forms-of-some-ethiopic-characters.-how-do-i-type-these-using-the-abyssinica-sil-font-how-do-i-use-features"><em>My
    language uses variant forms of some Ethiopic characters. How do I
    type these using the Abyssinica SIL font? How do I use
    features?</em></h4>
    <p>You should type the character the same way you would type the
    standard form of the character. Then, you need to select the
    variants to be displayed. If your application supports Graphite or
    the OpenType Character Variant features, you can use these to access
    the font features built into the font. See <a
    href="features.html">Font Features</a> page for more details.</p>
    <p>If your application does not support Graphite features or the
    OpenType Character Variants, you can use TypeTunerWeb to customize
    the font with the variants you require. See <a
    href="features.html">Font Features</a> page for more details.</p>
    <h4
    id="why-did-you-remove-the-stylistic-sets-from-ver.-2.000-of-the-abyssinica-sil-font"><em>Why
    did you remove the Stylistic Sets from ver. 2.000 of the Abyssinica
    SIL font?</em></h4>
    <p>Originally we added the Stylistic Sets because there was not a
    good solution for accessing the glyph variants in the font. At one
    point we also tried encoding them in the Private Use Area (PUA). PUA
    characters have now almost all been unencoded since the characters
    are now either encoded in Unicode or the variants are available
    through <strong>Character Variants</strong>. The Stylistic Sets were
    implemented inconsistently, and because of that we chose to remove
    them rather than attempt to fix them. If you still wish to use a
    font with Stylistic Sets, ver. 1.500 is still available on the <a
    href="previous-versions.html">Previous Versions</a> page.</p>
    <h4
    id="i-have-a-copy-of-the-sil-abyssinica-font.-can-you-tell-me-how-this-differs-from-abyssinica-sil"><em>I
    have a copy of the <strong>SIL Abyssinica</strong> font. Can you
    tell me how this differs from <strong>Abyssinica
    SIL</strong>?</em></h4>
    <p>It is best to upgrade to <strong>Abyssinica SIL</strong>.
    <strong>SIL Abyssinica</strong> (and <strong>SIL Abyssinica
    U</strong> and <strong>SIL Abyssinica G</strong>) was an early,
    unreleased version of <strong>Abyssinica SIL</strong>. Although a
    Unicode font, it only supported Unicode 3.0 and thus had a number of
    PUA characters in it which have since been added to Unicode 4.1 and
    6.0. You should convert your data to Unicode 6.0 and use
    <strong>Abyssinica SIL</strong>. A mapping file to convert your data
    from PUA to Unicode 6.0 is available here: <a
    href="https://github.com/silnrsi/wsresources/tree/master/scripts/Ethi/mappings/sil-pua-unicode">sil-pua-unicode</a>.
    If you do not convert your data to official Unicode codepoints you
    will never be able to use another Ethiopic font because those are
    <strong>Private</strong> codepoints and other fonts do not support
    them.</p>
    <h4
    id="you-have-characters-which-are-encoded-in-the-pua-area.-is-there-any-likelihood-that-these-will-ever-be-in-unicode-if-so-will-you-update-abyssinica-sil"><em>You
    have characters which are encoded in the PUA area. Is there any
    likelihood that these will ever be in Unicode? If so, will you
    update Abyssinica SIL?</em></h4>
    <p>Version 1.500 incorporated all characters that are in Unicode
    6.0.</p>
    <p>With version 2.000 we removed almost all of the PUA characters in
    the font because they are either available through their official
    Unicode codepoints or through the Character Variants.</p>
    <h4
    id="i-would-like-to-bundle-abyssinica-sil-with-my-application---can-i"><em>I
    would like to bundle Abyssinica SIL with my application - can
    I?</em></h4>
    <p>The <a href="https://openfontlicense.org/">SIL Open Font
    License</a> allows bundling with applications, even commercial ones,
    with some restrictions.</p>
