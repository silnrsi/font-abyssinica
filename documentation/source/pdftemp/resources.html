    </header>
    <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
    <p>This font is supported by all major operating systems (macOS, Windows, Linux-based, iOS, and Android), however the extent of that support depends on the individual OS and application.</p>
    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
    <p>Install the font by decompressing the .zip archive and installing the font using the standard font installation process for .ttf (TrueType/OpenType) fonts for your platform. For additional tips see the help page on <a href="../../pdf/https://software.sil.org/fonts/installation">Font installation</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="keyboarding-and-character-set-support">Keyboarding and character set support</h2>
    <p>This font does not include keyboards or other software for entering text. To type the symbols in this font use the keyboarding systems provided in your OS or use a separate utility. SIL’s <a href="../../pdf/https://keyman.com/">Keyman</a> is a cross-platform keyboarding system and a number of Ethiopic keyboards are available:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="../../pdf/https://keyman.com/keyboards/sil_ethiopic_power_g">SIL Power-G Ethiopic keyboard</a></li>
    <li><a href="../../pdf/https://keyman.com/keyboards/sil_ethiopic">SIL Ethiopic keyboard</a></li>
    <li><a href="../../pdf/https://keyman.com/keyboards/gff_blin">GFF Blin Keyboard</a></li>
    <li><a href="../../pdf/https://keyman.com/keyboards/gff_geez">GFF Ge'ez Keyboard</a></li>
    <li><a href="../../pdf/https://keyman.com/keyboards/gff_amharic">Amharic keyboard</a></li>
    <li><a href="../../pdf/https://keyman.com/keyboards/gff_tigrinya_ethiopia">GFF Tigrinya-Ethiopia Keyboard</a></li>
    <li><a href="../../pdf/https://keyman.com/keyboards/gff_tigrinya_eritrea">GFF Tigrinya-Eritrean Keyboard</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Various other means may be available for different operating-system platforms to create additional input methods. For instance, Windows (Vista and above) provides an Ethiopic IME.</p>
    <p>For information on other keyboarding options see the overview at <a href="../../pdf/https://scriptsource.org/entry/ytr8g8n6sw">Keyboard Systems Overview (ScriptSource)</a>.</p>
    <p>See <a href="../../pdf/charset.pdf">Character set support</a> for details of the Unicode characters supported by this font.</p>
    <h2 id="rendering-and-application-support">Rendering and application support</h2>
    <p>This font will work normally like any other font in most applications. If the writing system requires special diacritic positioning the application/OS will need to support OpenType.</p>
    <p>Abyssinica SIL is designed to work with two advanced font technologies, <a href="../../pdf/http://graphite.sil.org/">Graphite</a> and OpenType. To take advantage of the advanced typographic capabilities of this font, you must be using applications that provide an adequate level of support for Graphite or OpenType.</p>
    <p>Other suggestions are listed here: <a href="../../pdf/https://software.sil.org/fonts/features/">Using Font Features</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="web-fonts">Web fonts</h2>
    <p>Web font versions of this font (in WOFF and WOFF2 formats) are available in the <code>web</code> folder. These can be copied to a web server and used as fonts on web pages. A very basic HTML/CSS demo page is also included. For more information on the options and techniques available for using these fonts on web pages see <a href="../../pdf/http://software.sil.org/fonts/webfonts">Using SIL Fonts on Web Pages</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="text-conversion">Text conversion</h2>
    <p>This font is encoded according to <a href="../../pdf/http://unicode.org">The Unicode Standard</a>. If you have text that uses a legacy, non-Unicode encoding there are tools that can help you convert that text for use with Unicode fonts. See <a href="../../pdf/https://scriptsource.org/entry/xlzd6n5aqt">Introduction to Text Conversion and Transliteration</a>.</p>
    <p>In order to use this font with existing data that was created for use with fonts developed using custom-encoded fonts, it is necessary to re-type or convert data to produce data that is encoded in conformance with the Unicode Standard. <a href="../../pdf/https://software.sil.org/silconverters/">SIL Converters</a> and/or <a href="../../pdf/https://software.sil.org/teckit/">TECkit</a> can be used for character encoding conversion. TECkit allows users to write their own custom conversion mappings.</p>
    <p>Three <a href="../../pdf/https://software.sil.org/teckit/">TECkit</a> mapping files (compiled and uncompiled) are available as a separate download <a href="../../pdf/https://github.com/silnrsi/wsresources/tree/master/scripts/Ethi/mappings/latn-ethi">SIL-Ethiopia (Latin to Fidel) Unicode mapping</a>. They are intended for use where text has been input “phonetically” as a syllable ("be", "ppii", etc.) and conversion to fidel is desired (U+1264 ቤ, U+1352 ፒ, etc.).</p>
    <p>If you used an earlier version of the <strong>Abyssinica SIL</strong> font, and used some of the Private Use Area (PUA) codepoints in your data, you may wish to use the <a href="../../pdf/https://github.com/silnrsi/wsresources/tree/master/scripts/Ethi/mappings/sil-pua-unicode">PUA to Unicode mapping file</a> to convert your data from PUA codepoints to Unicode 6.0.</p>
    <p>The TECkit package is available for download from SIL’s <a href="../../pdf/https://software.sil.org/teckit/">TECkit</a> Web site.</p>
    <p>The SIL Converters package is available for download from SIL’s <a href="../../pdf/https://software.sil.org/silconverters/">SIL Converters</a> Web site.</p>
    <p><a href="../../pdf/https://github.com/geezorg/DocxConverter">Docx Converter for Legacy Ethiopic Font Encoding Systems</a> -- This tool is available (non-SIL) to assist in migrating Microsoft Word documents in pre-Unicode Ethiopic fonts into a Unicode font supporting Ethiopic script.</p>
